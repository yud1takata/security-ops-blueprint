# Sprint Plan: Exploitation Automation (2026-01)

## Purpose
Automate controlled exploitation workflows to validate lab defenses and detection coverage.

## Preconditions
- Backlog item BL-042 exists in `docs/backlog.md`.
- Vulnerability assessment results available for prioritization.

## Scope
- Exploitation automation for lab services (remote access, file sharing, management interfaces).
- Wordlist generation and credential attack automation (lab-only).
- Pass-the-hash and Linux service exploitation workflows (lab-only).
- Watering hole simulations in isolated lab segments.
- Evidence capture for exploit attempts, success, and failures.

## Out of scope
- Unapproved exploitation outside lab scope.
- Persistent access without explicit approval.

## Milestones
- M1 Target selection and safety checks (Day 1)
- M2 Automation of exploit chains (Days 2-3)
- M3 Validation evidence captured (Day 4)

## Work items (Backlog)
- BL-042: Exploitation automation

## Agent assignments
- PM: scope lock and risk approvals.
- Builder: exploit automation and safeguards.
- Analyst: validation and evidence capture.

## Purple team breakdown
- Red: define exploitation paths and objectives.
- Blue: tune detections for exploit attempts.
- Purple: align evidence with detection requirements.

## CISSP control objectives (thick)
- Due care/due diligence in controlled exploit testing.
- Auditability with evidence logs and chain of custody.
- Change control for exploit code and lab configs.
- Risk management and containment of exploit paths.

## Expected signals/telemetry
- IDS/EDR alerts for exploit behavior.
- Auth and service logs reflect exploit attempts.
- Evidence logs capture exploit artifacts and outcomes.

## Steps to run
1) Approve targets and safety checks.
2) Execute lab-only exploit automation.
3) Capture telemetry and evidence.
4) Review detection gaps and update plans.

## Validation checklist
- Exploit chains scripted and reproducible.
- Alerts generated for exploit attempts.
- Evidence logs saved in `docs/logs/`.

## Rollback/Revert
- Remove exploit artifacts and restore snapshots.
- Disable lab services if instability is observed.
