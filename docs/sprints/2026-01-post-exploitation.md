# Sprint Plan: Post-Exploitation Automation (2026-01)

## Purpose
Automate post-exploitation workflows to validate containment, detection, and recovery in the lab.

## Preconditions
- Backlog item BL-043 exists in `docs/backlog.md`.
- Exploitation workflows defined and approved.

## Scope
- Post-exploitation tooling operations and workflow automation.
- File transfer automation and evidence capture.
- Privilege escalation and impersonation tests (lab-only).
- Persistence, lateral movement, and pivoting workflows.
- Clear tracks simulations with reversible lab-only steps.
- Data encoding and exfiltration simulations (test data only).
- MITM and packet sniffing validation in isolated lab segments.

## Out of scope
- Any persistence outside lab scope.
- Real data exfiltration beyond simulated test data.

## Milestones
- M1 Post-exploitation workflow design (Day 1)
- M2 Automation and safety controls (Days 2-3)
- M3 Validation evidence captured (Day 4)

## Work items (Backlog)
- BL-043: Post-exploitation automation

## Agent assignments
- PM: scope lock and risk approvals.
- Builder: workflow automation and safety controls.
- Analyst: validation and evidence capture.

## Purple team breakdown
- Red: define post-exploitation objectives and techniques.
- Blue: tune detections for persistence and lateral movement.
- Purple: align evidence with detection coverage gaps.

## CISSP control objectives (thick)
- Least privilege and separation of duties for post-exploitation tooling.
- Auditability and evidence preservation.
- Risk management with containment and cleanup steps.
- Defense in depth and monitoring for lateral movement.

## Expected signals/telemetry
- Alerts for credential theft, persistence, and lateral movement.
- Network telemetry for exfiltration simulations.
- Evidence logs for all post-exploitation actions.

## Steps to run
1) Approve lab-only scope and test data sets.
2) Execute post-exploitation automation.
3) Capture logs and evidence.
4) Validate detections and update rules.

## Validation checklist
- Workflows scripted and reversible.
- Alerts observed for post-exploitation activity.
- Evidence logs saved in `docs/logs/`.

## Rollback/Revert
- Remove persistence artifacts and revert snapshots.
- Restore baseline credentials and access.
